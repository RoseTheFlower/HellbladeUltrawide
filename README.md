![](preview.jpg)

The tool perfectly corrects the field of view reduction affecting the game at 21:9 and wider resolutions since the Enhanced update.
Additionally, it allows to adjust the field of view at any aspect ratio in real time.

1. [Download](/../../releases) and unpack the archive.
2. Launch the game first, followed by the tool.
3. Press the hotkeys as shown.

All trainers based on CE components may trigger some anti-virus software.

Tested on the latest Steam version at 2560x1080, 3840x1080, and 5760x1080.
